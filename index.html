<h1>Delayed Orders</h1>

<p>This Delayed Orders Workflow aims to effectively manage customer inquiries related to delayed shipments, minimize disputes by providing timely communication and compensation options, and ensure customer satisfaction through clear resolutions including refunds, discounts, or replacement shipments.</p>

<h2>🔔 Important Note:</h2>

<p>Always prioritize resending the item according to our policy instead of issuing a refund. Refunds should only be offered if the customer threatens to file a dispute.</p>

  <h3>1. Initial Customer Outreach About Delay</h3>
  <p><strong>Customer Message:</strong> Asks about order delay or delivery time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Apologize for the inconvenience.</li>
    <li>Inform delivery timeline:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Delivery Time:</strong> 9–15 business days</li>
        <li><strong>Processing Time:</strong> 1–3 business days</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>If order is within delivery timeframe:</strong> Ask customer to wait, reassure them order is on track.</li>
    <li><strong>If order is outside delivery timeframe:</strong> Offer <strong>30% discount</strong> for a future purchase.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Customer Threatens to File a Dispute</h3>
  <p><strong>Customer Message:</strong> Threatens dispute due to delay.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Acknowledge frustration and apologize.</li>
    <li>Offer a <strong>30%–50% refund</strong> depending on case severity.</li>
    <li>Inform customer they will still receive the item.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Order Stuck in Transit (No Movement &gt; 5 Days)</h3>
  <p><strong>Condition:</strong> Tracking shows no update for more than 5 business days.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider item <strong>lost in transit</strong>.</li>
    <li>Contact supplier to resend the item.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Customer Communication After Confirmed Lost in Transit</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Inform customer item is lost in transit and replacement is being sent.</li>
    <li>Offer a <strong>30% discount</strong> code for a future purchase as apology.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Suggested Customer Response Samples</h2>
  
<details>
  <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold;">Within Timeframe</summary>

We sincerely apologize for the delay. Please note that our delivery timeframe is 9–15 business days, with an additional 1–3 days for processing. Your order is still within this window, and we expect it to arrive soon. Thank you for your patience!
  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold;">Outside Timeframe</summary>
  <ul>
We're very sorry your order hasn't arrived yet. As it's now past the expected delivery timeframe, we’d like to offer you a 30% discount code for your next purchase. Let us know if you’d like us to send it over!

  </ul>
</details>

<details>
  <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold;">Stuck >5 Days (Lost in Transit)</summary>
  <ul>

  <h1>Return Funnel - Customer Wants to Return</h1>

  <p>This return workflow is designed to provide alternative solutions to customers who wish to return their order for any reason other than damaged, incomplete, or incorrect items. The goal is to resolve issues efficiently—minimizing returns and operational costs—while maintaining customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>🔔 Important Note:</h2>

<p>Always offer a replacement first as the primary resolution for return-related inquiries (excluding damaged, incomplete, or incorrect orders). Replacements are subject to a small fee based on the original order value. This provides customers with a quick, lower-cost solution while avoiding the inconvenience of return shipping.</p>
<details>
  <summary style="cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold;">📦 View Replacement Fee Breakdown</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Orders $1–$60 USD → Replacement fee: <strong>$9.95 USD</strong></li>
    <li>Orders $60.01–$99 USD → Replacement fee: <strong>$14.95 USD</strong></li>
    <li>Orders $99.01 and above → Replacement fee: <strong>$19.95 USD</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1. Initial Customer Inquiry</h3>
  <p><strong>Action:</strong> Customer reaches out expressing disappointment with the product (e.g., chains don’t meet expectations).</p>
  <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Acknowledge the issue empathetically and apologize.</li>
    <li>Offer 10% refund without return to resolve the issue quickly and conveniently.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, offer a 20% discount on a future purchase as a gesture of goodwill.</li>
    <li>Clearly mention that return shipping is the customer's responsibility (typically $7–$10 USD), and customs charges may apply depending on the location.</li>
    <li>Recommend using tracked shipping for returns, as untrackable packages cannot be refunded.</li>
  </ul>

Thank you for your message, and I sincerely apologize for the disappointment with your recent order.

We truly regret that the chains did not meet your expectations. To help resolve this quickly and conveniently, we can offer you one of the following options:

A 10% refund of your order total — no return required. This is a fast and easy solution.
A 20% discount toward your next purchase — if you'd prefer to try something else from our collection.

If you would still prefer to return the items for a full refund, you're absolutely welcome to do so. Please note:

Return shipping costs (typically $7–$10 USD) are the responsibility of the customer.
Customs charges may apply depending on your location.
We strongly recommend using a tracked shipping method, as we are unable to process refunds for packages that are lost or untrackable.

Please let us know which option you prefer, and we’ll proceed accordingly.

  <h3>2. Customer Requests Higher or Full Refund (20% Refund)</h3>
  <p><strong>Action:</strong> Customer requests a higher or full refund instead of the 10% offer.</p>
  <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Express understanding and appreciation for their feedback.</li>
    <li>Offer 20% refund without return to resolve the issue in a more generous and quicker manner.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, offer a 40% discount on a future purchase as a gesture of goodwill.</li>
    <li>Reiterate that return shipping costs (typically $7–$10 USD) will be the customer’s responsibility if they decide to return the item, along with any potential customs charges.</li>
    <li>Emphasize the importance of tracked shipping to avoid issues with lost or untrackable returns.</li>
    <li>Ask the customer to confirm if they would prefer the 20% refund without return or would still like to return the product for a full refund.</li>

Thank you again for reaching out, and we truly appreciate your understanding and continued feedback.

I want to sincerely apologize once more for the inconvenience and dissatisfaction with your recent order. We understand how frustrating this must be.

As a gesture of goodwill, we’d like to increase our offer to a 20% refund of your order total — without requiring a return. We hope this helps address your concerns in a quicker and more convenient way.

Alternatively, if you'd prefer to give us another chance in the future, we’d be happy to offer you a 40% discount on your next purchase with us. This can be a great way to try something new from our collection at a significantly reduced price.

Of course, if you still prefer a full refund, we are happy to process it once the items are returned. Please note:

Return shipping costs (typically $7–$10 USD) are the customer’s responsibility.
Customs charges may apply depending on your location.
We strongly recommend using tracked shipping, as we are unable to process refunds for packages that are lost or untrackable.

Please let us know which option works best for you, and we’ll be ready to assist you right away.

  <h2>Email Handling & Supplier Issue Workflow</h2>

  <p>This Email Handling & Supplier Issue Workflow aims to ensure efficient issue resolution by assigning email responsibility, checking records to avoid duplication, contacting the correct supplier by order date, logging issues in the right tabs, and performing daily follow-ups for timely resolution and customer satisfaction.</p>

  <h3>1. Claim & Tag Emails</h3>
  <h4>What to Do:</h4>
  <ul> 
    <li><strong>Tag your name</strong> on any email you're handling to show responsibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not remove existing tags.</strong></li>
   <h4>Best Practice:</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>Use consistent naming or team member format for tagging.</li>
    <li>If you're unsure if someone else has followed up,<strong> communicate internally or check the Supplier Tasks and Issues sheet </strong> to verify if the issue has already been addressed or logged before taking action.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

  <h3>2. Open & Review the Supplier Tasks and Issues Sheet</h3>
  <p>Before replying to any customer, <strong> review all relevant tabs to: </strong> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid duplication</li>
    <li>Understand issue progress</li>
    <li>Check for supplier responses</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>🔍Tabs to Check:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer Issues</li>

  <ul>
       <li>Cancel allowed only if order is unfulfilled within 3 hours of placement.</li>

Discussion Points & Action Items:

1. Unboxing Video Requirement
- Moving forward, customers reporting damaged, incorrect, or incomplete items will be required to provide an unboxing video as proof.
- This measure will help verify claims and prevent misuse.
- To be incorporated into all relevant email templates and return instructions.

2. Manual Ticket Assignment & Prioritization
- If no improvement in ticket handling is seen within a week, manual assignment of tickets will begin.
- Each assigned agent will be fully responsible for the ticket until resolution is complete.
- Oldest/longest-waiting tickets must always be given top priority.

3. Response Time Target
- The target response time for all open tickets is being lowered to 12 hours.
- Aim: Improve customer satisfaction and reduce resolution delays.

4. Handling Product Quality Complaints
• When customers report quality issues:
  - Always apologize first.
  - Offer either a replacement or return option, depending on the customer’s tone and feedback
  - Replacements should be suggested only if the customer appears open to it.

5. Refund Exceptions Policy
• No refunds will be issued in the following situations:
  - Incorrect address provided at checkout
  - Failed delivery attempts
  - Refused deliveries
• These orders may only be eligible for reshipment with an applicable fee.

Time: 14:00 CET (35 minutes)  
Platform: Google Meet  
Attendees: Chan, Cath, Camil, Alvin, Ali, Marife  
Meeting Frequency: Every Tuesday & Friday at 14:00 CET  

Discussion Points & Action Items:

1. Replacement Orders & New Store  
- From now on, all replacement orders must be made in the new store system.  
- Everyone was shown how to create a new customer profile in the new system.  
- Make sure everything goes through the new store unless something isn't working — in that case, ask for help right away.

2. Sending Invoices  
- We went over how to send invoices properly from the new store.  
- After sending an invoice, remember to delete the draft order so there’s no confusion.

3. Productivity Tracking  
- We’re now tracking productivity based on how many messages you send, not how many conversations you handle.  
- This is because some customers send multiple emails until their issue is fully solved.

4. Low Volume Inbox  
- Since the inbox isn’t too busy right now, focus on clearing all order-related issues listed in the tracking sheet.

5. Customs Email Follow-Up  
- Use the email template provided when responding to customers who received messages about customs issues.  
- Log each case in the “CUSTOMS EMAIL REPORT” sheet.  
- Chan will look for and list the orders connected to these customers.

  <h1>🧭 Customer Issue Resolution Workflow</h1>

  <h2>1. Quality Concerns (Jewelry Appearance, Finish, Weight, Shine, etc.)</h2>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Customer feels the item does not meet expectations in terms of look, material, or overall feel.<br>
  <strong>Important:</strong> These are subjective concerns and are not valid for supplier reshipment requests.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>❌ <strong>Do not ask for photos</strong></li>
    <li>✅ Acknowledge and apologize for not meeting their expectations</li>
    <li>🤝 Offer resolution on a case-by-case basis:
      <ul>
        <li>→ Temp check the customer’s tone and response first</li>
        <li>→ If the customer seems mildly disappointed, offer a partial refund or discount (especially if they prefer to return)</li>
        <li>→ If the customer is not very upset, you may offer a replacement with fee — but only after following the Return Funnel</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>🗂️ Do not submit to supplier — this type of issue does not qualify for supplier reshipment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Sizing Does Not Fit</h2>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Customer says the item does not fit properly.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📏 Check if the item comes in other sizes
      <ul>
        <li>→ If available: offer replacement with reshipment fee</li>
        <li>→ If not: offer different item replacement (also with reshipment fee)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>💬 Clearly communicate that reshipment fee applies</li>
    <li>🧾 Follow up with correct invoice and shipping instructions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Damaged, Missing, or Incorrect Items</h2>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Jewelry item is damaged, incorrect, or something from the order is missing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📸 Request clear photos or videos from the customer showing the issue</li>
    <li>👁️ Review and confirm the issue yourself as a support rep (no need to wait for customer to say it’s wrong — you decide if valid)</li>
    <li>📩 Once confirmed on your end, submit the case to the supplier for reshipment</li>
    <li>🔁 Request reshipment from the supplier</li>
    <li>🧾 Wait for supplier to provide tracking or confirmation of the new shipment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Address or Item Change</h2>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Customer wants to change shipping address or ordered item.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📦 If order is unfulfilled: update directly in the system</li>
    <li>🚚 If order is fulfilled: request change from supplier (email or platform message)</li>
    <li>✅ Confirm with customer once change is made</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Return to Sender (RTS)</h2>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Parcel is returned by the courier.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🔍 Check reason for RTS</li>
    <li>🤝 Coordinate with supplier for reshipment fee</li>
    <li>💳 If customer error (e.g., wrong address):
      <ul>
        <li>→ Ask customer to cover the fee</li>
        <li>→ If they refuse: we can cover the fee</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>📩 Ask supplier to resend order and send invoice for payment by owner</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Delivered But Not Received</h2>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Order marked as delivered, but customer didn’t get it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📦 Request proof of delivery from supplier</li>
    <li>📤 Share the proof with the customer</li>
    <li>📄 If still not received: request proof of loss from customer (e.g., statement, ID)</li>
    <li>🔁 Once obtained, offer free reshipment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Delayed Orders</h2>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Order taking longer than expected to arrive.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>⏱️ Refer to Delayed Orders Workflow</li>
    <li>💬 Keep customer informed with tracking updates and delivery expectations</li>
    <li>🎯 Only offer resolution (refund/reshipment) if time exceeds stated limits and courier shows no progress</li>
  </ul>
